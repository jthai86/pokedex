Build a Pokedex

Welcome to Build a Pokedex! 

This project is a command-line Pokedex built in Go. Using the amazing PokéAPI
, it fetches all the data you need about Pokémon — including their names, types, stats, and more. Don’t worry if you’re new to Pokémon — a Pokedex is just a fictional device for looking up Pokémon information.
